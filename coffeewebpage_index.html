                    <p> Coffee is a popular drink made from roasted coffee beans. 
                        It has caffeine, which helps people feel awake and fresh. 
                        Many people drink coffee in the morning or during work to stay active. 
                        There are different types of coffee, like espresso, latte, and cappuccino. 
                        Some people like it black, while others add milk or sugar. 
                        Coffee is grown in countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Ethiopia. 
                        It can be made using a coffee maker, filter, or instant powder. 
                        Drinking too much coffee may cause sleep problems. 
                        A warm cup of coffee is a great way to relax and enjoy the day.. </p>
